## 3. Pipeline Stages

The pipeline executes the following stages in order:

### Stage 1: Load Patch Metadata

Reads the Condor patch header file (`h{patch_id}.txt`) to extract:
- UTM zone number
- Translation offsets (TranslateX, TranslateY)

### Stage 2: Create Projector

Initializes the Transverse Mercator projector with UTM zone and translation offsets for converting WGS84 lat/lon to local Condor coordinates.

### Stage 3: Load Terrain Mesh

Loads the terrain OBJ file (`h{patch_id}.obj`) and builds a spatial index for efficient terrain queries.

### Stage 4: Parse OSM Buildings

Parses the OSM XML file, extracting:
- Node coordinates
- Way definitions (building footprints)
- Multipolygon relations (buildings with holes)
- Building tags (type, height, roof shape, etc.)

### Stage 5: Filter Buildings

Removes buildings that:
- Have centroids outside patch bounds (±2880m from origin)
- Are on patch edges (to avoid partial rendering)

### Stage 6: Process Buildings

For each building:
1. Compute floor Z from terrain intersection
2. Select roof type based on category and OSM tags
3. Analyze footprint for gabled eligibility
4. Generate LOD0 mesh (walls + roof with overhang)
5. Generate LOD1 mesh (walls + roof without overhang)

### Stage 7: Export OBJ Files

Exports combined meshes to:
- `o{patch_id}_LOD0.obj` - Detailed mesh
- `o{patch_id}_LOD1.obj` - Simplified mesh

### Stage 8: Generate Report

Creates `o{patch_id}_report.json` with statistics.

---

## 4. Coordinate System

### Condor Coordinate System

- **Origin:** Center of patch (0, 0, 0)
- **X-axis:** Positive East
- **Y-axis:** Positive North
- **Z-axis:** Positive Up
- **Patch extent:** ±2880m (5760m × 5760m total)

### Projection

The pipeline uses UTM (Transverse Mercator) projection:

```python
class TransverseMercatorProjector:
    def project(self, lat: float, lon: float) -> Tuple[float, float]:
        # 1. Convert lat/lon to UTM easting/northing
        # 2. Apply Condor translation offsets
        # 3. Return (x, y) in local coordinates
```

**Parameters from h*.txt:**
- `ZoneNumber`: UTM zone (e.g., 33 for Slovenia)
- `TranslateX`: X offset (typically negative UTM easting)
- `TranslateY`: Y offset (typically negative UTM northing)

### Winding Order

All geometry uses **counter-clockwise (CCW)** winding for outward-facing normals:
- Outer rings: CCW
- Holes: CW (reversed for inward-facing normals)
- Faces: CCW vertices for outward normal

---

## 5. Data Models

### Point2D / Point3D

```python
@dataclass
class Point2D:
    x: float
    y: float

@dataclass
class Point3D:
    x: float
    y: float
    z: float
```

### Polygon

```python
@dataclass
class Polygon:
    outer_ring: List[Point2D]  # CCW winding
    holes: List[List[Point2D]] # CW winding each

    def area(self) -> float
    def bbox(self) -> BBox
    def has_holes(self) -> bool
```

### BuildingRecord

```python
@dataclass
class BuildingRecord:
    osm_id: str
    category: BuildingCategory    # HOUSE, APARTMENT, INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL, OTHER
    footprint: Polygon
    floors: int                   # Number of floors (default 2)
    height_m: float               # Wall height in meters
    roof_type: RoofType           # GABLED, FLAT, HIPPED
    roof_pitch_deg: float         # Pitch angle (30-60°)
    roof_direction_deg: float     # Ridge direction (0=East, CCW)
    floor_z: float                # Ground elevation from terrain
    seed: int                     # Deterministic random seed

    @property
    def wall_top_z(self) -> float  # floor_z + height_m
```

### MeshData

```python
@dataclass
class MeshData:
    osm_id: str
    vertices: List[Point3D]
    faces: List[List[int]]  # 0-indexed vertex indices

    def add_vertex(x, y, z) -> int       # Returns vertex index
    def add_triangle(v0, v1, v2)         # CCW winding
    def add_quad(v0, v1, v2, v3)         # CCW winding
    def merge(other: MeshData)           # Combine meshes
```

---

## 6. OSM Parsing

### Supported Elements

| Element | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `<node>` | Coordinate storage (lat/lon) |
| `<way>` | Simple building footprints |
| `<relation type="multipolygon">` | Buildings with holes |

### Tag Extraction

| OSM Tag | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `building=*` | Building type classification |
| `building:levels` | Number of floors |
| `height` | Total building height |
| `roof:shape` | Roof type (gabled, flat, hipped) |
| `roof:direction` | Ridge direction in degrees |
| `roof:angle` | Roof pitch angle |

### Multipolygon Handling

The parser uses `way_stitcher.py` to handle multipolygon relations where outer/inner rings are split across multiple ways:

```python
def stitch_ways(segments: List[WaySegment]) -> List[List[str]]:
    """
    Stitch way segments into closed rings.
    Handles unordered segments by matching endpoints.
    """
```

### Footprint Processing

After parsing, footprints are processed:
1. **Close ring** - Ensure first == last vertex
2. **Remove collinear points** - Simplify without changing shape
3. **Normalize winding** - CCW for outer, CW for holes

---

## 7. Building Classification

### Category Detection

Buildings are classified based on OSM `building=*` tag:

| Category | OSM Values |
|----------|-----------|
| HOUSE | house, detached, semidetached_house, terrace, farm, villa, bungalow |
| APARTMENT | apartments, flats, dormitory, tower, block |
| INDUSTRIAL | industrial, warehouse, factory, hangar, barn, silo |
| COMMERCIAL | commercial, retail, office, hotel, shop, restaurant, school |
| OTHER | yes, unknown values |

### Roof Type Selection

The `select_roof_type()` function determines roof type based on a configurable selection mode.

#### Roof Selection Modes (v0.3.5+)

Two modes are available via `--roof-selection-mode`:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `geometry` | (Default) Use geometry + category heuristics + area |
| `osm_tags_only` | Only buildings tagged as houses get pitched roofs |

#### Mode: `geometry` (Default)

1. **OSM tag** - If `roof:shape` is specified, use it
2. **Category rules:**
   - INDUSTRIAL → FLAT
   - COMMERCIAL → FLAT if >2 floors or >8m height
   - APARTMENT → FLAT if >3 floors or >10m height
   - HOUSE → GABLED
3. **Area heuristic for OTHER:**
   - < 200 m² → GABLED (likely house)
   - 200-400 m² → GABLED if ≤2 floors and ≤8m, else FLAT
   - > 400 m² → FLAT (likely industrial/commercial)

#### Mode: `osm_tags_only`

Only `BuildingCategory.HOUSE` receives pitched roofs:
- `building=house`, `detached`, `villa`, `bungalow`, etc. → GABLED (or HIPPED with `--random-hipped`)
- `building=yes`, `apartments`, `commercial`, etc. → FLAT

This mode is useful when OSM data has good building type tagging and you want to avoid false positives.

### Height Estimation

When height is not specified in OSM:

```python
def estimate_height(footprint_area: float, category: BuildingCategory):
    floor_height = 3.0  # meters per floor

    if category == INDUSTRIAL:
        return 1, 6.0
    elif category == APARTMENT:
        if area > 500: return 4, 12.0
        elif area > 200: return 3, 9.0
        else: return 2, 6.0
    # ... etc
```

---

## 8. Roof Generation

### Gabled Roof Algorithm

The gabled roof generator uses an **OBB-based approach** that guarantees no self-intersection:

#### Fixed Gable Height (v0.2.5+)

As of Phase 1, gabled roofs use a **fixed gable height of 3.0m** instead of calculating from pitch angle:

```python
GABLE_HEIGHT_FIXED = 3.0  # meters

# Ridge height is always 3.0m above wall top
ridge_z = wall_top_z + GABLE_HEIGHT_FIXED

# Pitch is now derived (for reference only)
derived_pitch = atan(3.0 / half_width)
```

This simplifies UV mapping since all gable triangles have the same height.

#### Step 1: Compute Ridge Direction

```python
def _get_ridge_direction(building, ring) -> float:
    # If OSM specifies direction, use it
    if building.roof_direction_deg is not None:
        return building.roof_direction_deg

    # Otherwise: ridge runs PARALLEL to longest edge
    ridge_direction = compute_longest_edge_axis(ring)
    return ridge_direction
```

**Key insight:** The ridge runs **parallel** to the longest edge of a building. The span (eave-to-eave distance) is the short dimension.

#### Step 2: Compute OBB

```python
def compute_obb(ring, direction_deg) -> dict:
    """
    Compute Oriented Bounding Box along given direction.

    Returns:
        - length: Size along direction (ridge length)
        - width: Size perpendicular (eave-to-eave distance)
        - center_x, center_y: OBB center
    """
```

#### Step 3: Generate Roof Geometry

```
Geometry layout (looking down, ridge points right →):

    c3 -------- r0 -------- c0
    |           |           |
    |   LEFT    |   RIGHT   |
    |   SLOPE   |   SLOPE   |
    |           |           |
    c2 -------- r1 -------- c1

Vertices:
- c0-c3: Eave corners at wall_top_z
- r0-r1: Ridge endpoints at wall_top_z + ridge_height

Faces (CCW winding):
- Right slope: c1 → c0 → r0 → r1
- Left slope: c3 → r0 → r1 → c2
- Back gable: c0 → c3 → r0
- Front gable: c2 → c1 → r1
```

#### Step 4: Generate Gable End Walls (Pentagonal Architecture)

As of v0.2.4, gabled buildings use **pentagonal gable walls** that extend from floor to ridge as a single solid body:

```
        v4 (apex at ridge_z)
        /\
       /  \
      /    \
   v3 ------ v2  (wall_top_z / eave)
    |        |
    |  RECT  |   <- Pentagon face
    |        |
   v0 ------ v1  (floor_z)
```

**Key architectural change:** The walls are one body (including gable), and the roof is an independent floating body (2 slope planes only).

For 1-floor buildings, the gable is a **separate triangular face** to enable proper UV mapping:
- Rectangle (floor to wall_top): ground section texture
- Triangle (wall_top to ridge): gable section texture

For multi-floor buildings, a single pentagon face is used.

### Gabled Eligibility Criteria

Not all footprints can have gabled roofs. Eligibility checks:

| Criterion | Threshold | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Vertex count | = 4 | Only rectangles (simplified from ≤20) |
| Convexity | Strictly convex | All cross products same sign |
| Rectangularity | ≥ 0.70 | Area/OBB ratio threshold |
| Angle tolerance | ±25° from 90° | Must be rectangle-like |
| Holes | None | Cannot gable buildings with courtyards |
| Floors | ≤ 2 | Gabled roofs only for 1-2 floor buildings |

**House-scale size gate (v0.2.1+, thresholds increased v0.3.6):**

| Criterion | Threshold | Fallback Reason |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Footprint area | ≤ 360 m² | `too_large_area` |
| Side length | 3.2m - 30m | `too_short_side` / `too_long_side` |
| Aspect ratio | ≤ 4.8 | `too_elongated` |

If any criterion fails, the building falls back to a flat roof with an explicit fallback reason.

### Ridge Height (Fixed)

As of v0.2.5, ridge height is **fixed at 3.0m**:

```python
ridge_height = GABLE_HEIGHT_FIXED  # 3.0m
derived_pitch = atan(3.0 / half_width)  # For reference only
```

### Overhang

- LOD0: 0.5m overhang (extends all eave edges)
- LOD1: No overhang

Roof slope is calculated so that at the overhang edge, Z = wall_top_z (visible overhang).

### Double-Sided Roof Faces (v0.2.3+)

Roof faces are duplicated with reversed winding for visibility from below:

```python
def _duplicate_faces_reversed(mesh, start_idx, end_idx):
    for face in mesh.faces[start_idx:end_idx]:
        reversed_face = face[::-1]  # Flip normal
        mesh.faces.append(reversed_face)
```

### Flat Roof

For flat roofs, the footprint is triangulated directly at `wall_top_z` using ear-clipping triangulation. UV coordinates use world-space XY scaled to 3m = 1.0 UV unit.

### Hipped Roof (v0.3.4+, Z fix v0.3.6, polyskel v0.6.0)

Hipped roofs are generated using two different algorithms depending on vertex count:

#### Analytical Hipped (4 vertices)

For quadrilateral buildings, uses BLOSM's analytical solution:

**Algorithm:**
1. Compute edge geometry (vectors, lengths, angles) on ORIGINAL footprint
2. Calculate "edge event" distances where bisectors meet
3. Find ridge endpoints from minimum distance edges
4. Create 4 roof faces: 2 triangular hips + 2 trapezoidal sides

**Special case:** Square footprints generate pyramidal roofs (single apex point).

#### Polyskel Hipped (5-12 vertices, Blender only)

For buildings with more than 4 vertices (L-shaped, T-shaped, U-shaped), uses the bpypolyskel straight skeleton algorithm:

**Algorithm:**
1. Compute straight skeleton of footprint polygon
2. Convert skeleton to roof faces with proper ridge lines and valleys
3. Apply overhang by expanding footprint before skeletonization
4. Adjust eave Z based on computed roof pitch

**Eligibility for polyskel:**
- Vertex count: 5-12 (configurable via `POLYSKEL_MAX_VERTICES`)
- No holes in footprint
- House-scale dimensions
- Floor count ≤ 2
- Running in Blender (requires mathutils)

**Configuration (both algorithms):**
- Fixed height: 3.0m (same as gabled)
- Max floors: 2 (same as gabled)
- Selection: Via OSM tag `roof:shape=hipped` or `--random-hipped` flag

**Geometry (v0.3.6 fix):**

The roof is positioned so the slope plane passes through `wall_top_z` at the original footprint boundary. When there is overhang, the eave corners are BELOW `wall_top_z`:

```python
tan_pitch = roof_height / max_distance_to_ridge
eave_z = wall_top_z - tan_pitch * overhang  # Lower due to slope
```

This ensures the roof "sits" correctly on the walls with no visible gap.

---

## 9. Wall Generation

Walls are generated by extruding each footprint edge vertically from `floor_z` to `wall_top_z`.

```python
def generate_walls(building):
    for each edge (p0, p1) in outer_ring:
        # Create quad: bottom-left, bottom-right, top-right, top-left
        # CCW winding for outward-facing normal
        mesh.add_quad(bl, br, tr, tl)

    for each hole:
        for each edge in hole:
            # Reversed winding for inward-facing normal
            mesh.add_quad(...)
```

**Walls follow exact footprint** - no simplification or OBB approximation.

### Wall Architecture for Gabled Buildings (v0.2.4+)

For gabled buildings, walls are generated with special handling:

**Side walls** (parallel to ridge): Rectangular quads from floor_z to wall_top_z

**Gable end walls** (perpendicular to ridge):
- 1-floor buildings: Rectangle + separate triangle
- Multi-floor buildings: Pentagon (single face)

```python
def generate_walls_for_gabled(building, ridge_direction_deg, ridge_z, obb_center):
    for each edge in footprint:
        if edge perpendicular to ridge (dot < 0.3):
            # GABLE END
            if building.floors == 1:
                generate_separated_gable_wall()  # rect + triangle
            else:
                generate_pentagonal_gable_wall()  # pentagon
        else:
            # SIDE WALL
            generate_side_wall_with_uvs()  # rectangle
```

---

## 10. UV Mapping and Texture Atlas (Phase 2)

### Texture Atlas Layout

```
Atlas: 512 x 12288 pixels
U: [0..∞] horizontal (wraps for tiling)
V: [0..1] vertical (NO wrapping - stays within slice)

ROOF REGION (V in [0.75, 1.0]):
├── Pattern 0: V [0.9583, 1.0000]
├── Pattern 1: V [0.9167, 0.9583]
├── Pattern 2: V [0.8750, 0.9167]
├── Pattern 3: V [0.8333, 0.8750]
├── Pattern 4: V [0.7917, 0.8333]
└── Pattern 5: V [0.7500, 0.7917]

FACADE REGION (V in [0.0, 0.75]):
12 styles, each with 3 sections:
├── GABLE (no windows):     top of block
├── UPPER (windows only):   middle of block
└── GROUND (doors+windows): bottom of block

Each style occupies V range of 0.0625 (0.75 / 12)
Each section occupies V range of ~0.0208 (0.0625 / 3)
```

### UV Coordinate Convention

- **V = 1.0** at atlas TOP (pixel y = 0)
- **V = 0.0** at atlas BOTTOM (pixel y = 12288)
- Roofs at TOP of atlas (high V), Facades at BOTTOM (low V)

### Wall UV Mapping

**Scale (v0.3.4):** 3 meters = 0.33 U units (1/3 of texture width)

**U offset:** Walls start at U = 0.33 to skip door section:
```
U 0.00 → 0.33 = Door section (skipped by default)
U 0.33 → 0.66 = Window section
U 0.66 → 1.00 = Window section
```

**Rounding:** Wall width rounded UP to nearest 3m multiple using `ceil()`

```python
def compute_wall_u_range(wall_width_m: float) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    rounded_width = ceil(wall_width_m / 3.0) * 3.0
    u_span = (rounded_width / 3.0) * 0.3333
    u_start = 0.3333  # Skip door section
    u_end = u_start + u_span
    return u_start, u_end
```

### Multi-Floor Wall UV Mapping

For gabled buildings (max 2 floors), sidewalls use **continuous UV mapping**:
- Single quad spans entire wall height
- GPU interpolates UV coordinates linearly
- z=0-3m maps to ground section, z=3-6m maps to upper section

For flat-roof buildings (3+ floors), walls are split into per-floor quads.

### Roof UV Mapping

- V: ridge (v_max) → eave (v_min), full slice height
- U: `u_span = roof_length / roof_width` (preserves aspect ratio)
- Can wrap horizontally (U > 1.0)

### Variation Selection

Deterministic per-building using seed:

```python
rng = random.Random(building.seed)
roof_index = rng.randint(0, 5)    # 6 patterns
facade_index = rng.randint(0, 11) # 12 styles
```

Same seed always produces same variations across runs.

### OBJ Export Format (v0.3.0+)

```obj
v 0.000000 0.000000 100.000000
v 10.000000 0.000000 100.000000
vt 0.333333 0.687500
vt 3.666667 0.687500
f 1/1 2/2 3/3
```

---

## 11. Terrain Integration

### Terrain Mesh

The terrain is loaded from `h{patch_id}.obj`:
- Typically 73,728 triangles per patch
- 30m grid spacing

### Spatial Index

A grid-based spatial index accelerates terrain queries:

```python
class GridSpatialIndex:
    def __init__(self, triangles, cell_size=60.0):
        # Build grid of triangle references

    def query(self, bbox) -> List[TerrainTriangle]:
        # Return triangles overlapping bbox
```

### Floor Z Computation

The `FloorZSolver` determines ground level for each building:

```python
class FloorZSolver:
    def solve(self, footprint: Polygon) -> FloorZResult:
        # 1. Get terrain triangles under footprint
        # 2. Find minimum Z of footprint-triangle intersections
        # 3. Subtract epsilon (0.3m) to ensure building is below terrain
        return FloorZResult(floor_z=min_z - epsilon)
```

This ensures buildings don't "float" above terrain on slopes.

---

## 12. Output Format

## 15. Test Results

### Patch 036019 (Slovenia) - v0.3.6 (with --random-hipped)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Buildings parsed | 5,635 |
| Buildings filtered | 219 (edge proximity) |
| Buildings processed | 5,416 |
| Gabled roofs | 1,065 (19.7%) |
| Hipped roofs | 900 (16.6%) |
| Flat roofs | 3,451 (63.7%) |
| Total pitched roofs | 1,965 (36.3%) |
| Gabled fallbacks | 2,754 |
| Hipped fallbacks | 154 |
| LOD0 vertices | 338,663 |
| LOD0 faces | 189,113 |
| Terrain triangles | 73,728 |
| Processing time | ~5.6 seconds |

### Footprint Vertex Distribution

| Vertices | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| 4 (rectangles) | 2,529 | 46.7% |
| 5-6 | 1,181 | 21.8% |
| 7-8 | 841 | 15.5% |
| 9+ | 865 | 16.0% |

### Fallback Reasons (v0.3.6)

| Reason | Count |
|--------|-------|
| `too_many_vertices` | 1,434 |
| `too_many_floors` | 1,346 |
| `too_short_side` | 77 |
| `bad_aspect_ratio` | 36 |
| `too_long_side` | 6 |
| `too_elongated` | 3 |
| `not_rectangle_angles` | 2 |
| `too_large_area` | 2 |
| `has_holes` | 1 |
| `not_rectangular_enough` | 1 |

### Notes on Fallback Distribution

The significant increase in flat roofs (from 11.9% in v0.1.0 to 66.6% in v0.3.4) is due to:

1. **Stricter geometry gate**: Only 4-vertex rectangles allowed (was ≤20 vertices)
2. **Floor limit**: Buildings with 3+ floors now fall back to flat
3. **House-scale gate**: Large buildings (apartments, industrial) now correctly get flat roofs

---

## 16. Pending Work

### Completed (v0.3.4)

- [x] UV Mapping Implementation (Phase 2)
- [x] Texture Atlas Support (6 roof patterns, 12 facade styles)
- [x] Hipped Roof Support (BLOSM analytical solution)
- [x] Fixed Gable Height (3.0m constant)
- [x] Pentagonal Gable Walls Architecture
- [x] Floor Limit for Gabled/Hipped Roofs (max 2 floors)
- [x] House-Scale Gate for Roof Type Selection
- [x] UV V Coordinate Inversion Fix
- [x] Multi-Floor Wall UV Mapping
- [x] Wall UV Scale Update (3m blocks, door offset)

### High Priority

#### 1. MTL File Generation

Generate MTL file with texture references for Condor:
- Material definitions for walls and roofs
- Texture file references

#### 2. Texture Atlas Creation

Create actual texture image files:
- 6 roof patterns (tiles, shingles, etc.)
- 12 facade styles (3 sections each)

#### 3. Floor Z Extension

Extend building base below terrain level to prevent visual gaps on sloped terrain. Current epsilon (0.3m) may be insufficient for steep slopes.

### Medium Priority

#### 4. Geometry Optimization

- Vertex deduplication (currently creates duplicate vertices)
- Mesh simplification for LOD1
- Normal generation for smooth shading

#### 5. LOD1 Simplification

Currently LOD1 differs only by lack of overhang. Consider:
- Reduced vertex count
- Simplified geometry for distant viewing

### Low Priority

#### 6. Special Building Types

- Churches with steeples
- Hangars with curved roofs
- Towers

#### 7. Performance Optimization

- Parallel processing for large patches
- Incremental processing (only changed buildings)

## Appendix A: BLOSM Roof Semantics

The roof direction semantics follow BLOSM conventions:

- `roof:direction` in OSM = **slope direction** (perpendicular to ridge)
- Longest edge of footprint = **ridge direction** (ridge runs parallel to long edge)
- Span (eave-to-eave distance) = short dimension of building

**Important (v0.2.1 fix):** The ridge runs **parallel** to the longest edge, not perpendicular. This ensures the roof span is the short dimension, producing correctly proportioned roofs.
